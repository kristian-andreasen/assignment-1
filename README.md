This website uses vanilla JavaScript to make the page interactive by dynamically manipulating the DOM. However there is no backend, so data is not saved and stored for the user. This means that every time the user refreshes the page, all changes are lost.

##Learning goals:
Manipulate HTML using JavaScript
Use JavaScript arrays
Bind events to HTML elements
Listen for events from HTML elements
Write custom CSS to style HTML elements and layouts
